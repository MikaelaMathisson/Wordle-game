        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
            This project aimed to develop a Wordle-inspired game with a highscore
            list and an "about" page. It is a full-stack application with three main
            pages: a homepage for playing the game, a static information page about
            the project, and a server-rendered highscore list.
        </p>
        <h3>Game Development:</h3>
        <p>
            The game was built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express
            for the backend. It follows the rules defined in the course's initial
            assignment, where players guess a randomly selected word, with feedback
            provided based on correctness and position. The backend API handles the
            game logic and word selection, ensuring a seamless gaming experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Highscore List:</h3>
        <p>
            A highscore list, stored persistently in a database, showcases the top
            performers. Users can submit their scores, including their name, time
            taken, number of guesses, and word settings. The highscore list is
            server-rendered, providing an efficient way to track and compare player
            performance.
        </p>
        <h3>About Page:</h3>
        <p>
            An informative static page provides an overview of the project,
            detailing its purpose, features, and technologies used.
        </p>
