      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Wordle is a word puzzle game where players try to guess a secret
        five-letter word. Each guess is evaluated based on correctness and
        position, with feedback provided to help players deduce the correct
        word.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The game consists of a five-letter word chosen randomly from a
        predefined set of words. Players make guesses, and the game provides
        feedback after each attempt, indicating if letters are correct and/or in
        the right position.
      </p>
